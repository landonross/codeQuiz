# codeQuiz

This is a timed Javascript quiz to test your knowledge on all things Javascript!

I have created an HTML, CSS, and JS file to create this task and have applied the following to my code.

1. A start button to start the quiz once the player is ready.

1. A 30 second timer that appears in the upper right-hand corner of the screen to show how much time is left.
1. Questions and answers that cycle through as the player answers the questions.
1. If a player gets a question wrong, 5 seconds is taken from the remaining time.
1. Once player finishes the quiz, a prompt is brought up to request the users initials.
1. Once the initials are provided JS code is able to combine the seconds left and the players initials to give a name and highscore for the player.
1. If the player wants to see their previous score, they can click on "View High Scores".
    1. I am still working on this code to show more than 1 previous score and to possibly only give the highest recent score.

Instructions on how the page works is provided on the left-hand side of the page where the player can review and understand how the quiz works and is scored.
